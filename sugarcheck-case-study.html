        <h3 class="underline">Introduction</h3>
        <p  class="text">This project was a group submission for a university hackathon centred around leveraging digital solutions to improve the delivery of healthcare initiatives. Our team elected to propose a solution aimed towards patients diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, with consideration for the rise in wearable healthcare devices.  </p>
        <h3 class="underline">The Problem</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Diabetes is a growing epidemic in Australia, with approximately 6% of Australian adults suffering from either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Ageing adults are especially at risk, and its estimated that around 1 in 6 people aged over 65 are diagnosed with the disease. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Managing diabetes in older people poses its own unique challenges, and many are unable to take the appropriate medication needed due to the potential complications with other age-related diseases. As such, many ageing adults need to rely on alternative methods to keep their diabetes in check, otherwise they run the risk of developing more chronic conditions in the long-term.   
          </p>
        <h3 class="underline">Research</h3>
        <p class="text">
            To build an understanding of the targeted end-user of the product, our team conducted a number of qualitative interviews and focus groups to identify the specific goals and desired outcomes of this segment. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Our findings indicated that although many health tracking apps designed to be used on smartphones and computers exist, many have a steep learning curve and seniors are often hesitant to use technology they are unfamiliar with. As such, they often resort to more dated technologies that may impede them from effectively monitoring their health. 
            <br>
            <br>
            A common sentiment amongst interviewees revealed a mindset statement “I only like to own technology that I feel is necessary”, and is reflective of Ostlund’s (2005) observation that ageing people have the capacity—but not necessarily the need—to learn new, mainstream technologies.

        <h3 class="underline">Ideation</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Using insights from our research, we pinpointed 3 key features that would enable our target end-user achieve their desired outcome:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The app exchanges information from a glucose monitoring patch, permanently installed into the skin, connected via Bluetooth</li>
            <li>The screen will update to display real-time blood glucose levels every 5 minutes, as data is sent from the patch </li>
            <li>Initiates visual, physical and audio indicators if blood sugar reaches abnormal levels
            </li>
        </ul>
           <br>
          <p class="text">
              A storyboard to visualise the workflow of the product was created:

            </div>
        <h3 class="underline">Testing</h3>
        <p class="text">
            To put these concepts to practice, our team drafted a set of lo-fi wireframes and simulated a real-time user interaction with samples matching the segment characteristics of the identified persona.

        <h3 class="underline">Solution</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Following our testing, we made several refinements and improvements to create a final high-fidelity prototype:
