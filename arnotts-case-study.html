        <h3 class="underline">Introduction</h3>
        <p  class="text">As a part of my marketing capstone for my university course, I developed my project around addressing Arnott's. 
            This was a great opportunity for me to apply my marketing research skills in the context of a real-world problem, and a chance to practice my product development skills. </p>
        <h3 class="underline">The Problem</h3>
        <p class="text">
          Arnott’s has traditionally benefited from its strong Australian
          heritage and loyal buyer base as its defining force behind its
          position in the market - however changing market conditions and an
          rapidly updating consumer trends have made it difficult for the brand
          to upkeep its relevance with Australian consumers.
          </p>
          <ul class="description-list">
            <li>Lacking options catered to the younger generations' changing consumer trends</li>
            <li>Struggling to deliver innovation to keep up with fierce competitors</li>
               <li>Packaging limitations changing consumption behaviours and patterns</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3 class="underline">Research</h3>
        <p class="text">
                Following from this, I collected both quantitative and qualitative responses from a sampling of the target population to identify segments that have been neglected or not adequately addressed by Arnott’s current marketing approach: 
            </p>
            <p class="description-list"><b>Segment Characteristics</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Between the ages of 18-34 years old</li>
                <li>Less likely to have household dependents </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p class="description-list"><b>Key Trends & Pain Points</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Preferential shift towards ‘convenience eating’ & on the go food products, eating out instead of cooking</li>
                <li>Packaging is a key purchasing determinant in ready-to-eat food products, with a preference for reusable/accessible packing solutions  </li>
                <li>Tend to take into consideration external factors such as corporate social responsibility and environmental impact when making purchasing decisions </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        <h3 class="underline">Ideation</h3>
        <p class="text">
            To assist in identifying the key behavioural and descriptive traits of this segment, a persona was created of a sample individual 
            matching these segmentation characteristics. The persona was created using insights derived from qualitative and quantitative interview responses conducted during the initial situational analysis.

        <h3 class="underline">Solution</h3>
        <p class="text">
            A proposed NPD titled ‘Arnott’s Nibbles’ will act as a brand extension to Arnott’s existing ‘classics’ range - leveraging the familiarity that consumers will already have towards these products. The product will offer miniature bite-sized versions of existing Arnott’s products packaged in a resealable bag, and will be positioned as an ‘on-the-go’ snacking alternative to the brand’s existing biscuit line. 
            </p>
 
            <div class="center">
                <img class="description-image" src="images/arnotts-sample.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p class="text">The ‘Arnott’s Nibbles’ product range will aim to address and remedy the specified pain points of the targeted segment - the key points being unsuitable portion sizes, sustainable packaging, and convenience. By doing so, consumers who identify with these pain points are likely to resonate with the product and its ability to deliver a solution to these issues - thereby creating a solid purchase intention and boosting Arnott’s overall brand relevance to the consumer.
